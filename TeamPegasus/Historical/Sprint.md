Good
- Fixed the GUI tests
- Done a sprint review Demo :)
- Started on fixing honeycomb patterns
- Good progress on the state-base workflow!
- Verbs moved from Flyway-dev (check)

Better
- We cant release for Mac anymore (pending any ideas on how to fix - 3 weeks now)

Tracking
- Mac is taking a long time to diagnose and fix
- Do we still want to work through FWD as a user (James + Bradley)
