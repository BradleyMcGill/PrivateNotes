Good
- 30-09-24 Shares useful key binds with the team
- 02-10-24 Very interesting discussion with Ajay about where prepare/deploy belongs and picked through some problems verbally

Better
- 02-10-24 Could be good to reflect some of his thoughts in writing. While it is obvious that problems have been thought out and carefully realised, some of the details can be lost due to a lack of written documentation. For example, here James had to explain the thought process behind the deploy script extension being a part of flyway-core to Ajay as Ajay as not a part of the mob the day prior. There was initial confusion that could have been remedied via notes on the PR pertaining to the decision.
